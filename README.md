## Background
This report was made for a task in people analytics subject of an MBA course; therefore, this data is a fraction of the company's lifetime, real and made to be anonymous about the company and companies dismisses. There is no reference that can link to a person or recognize the company.

## Business Case
The main goal of this research was to find out about turnover rates and the causes. The HR team is not looking for individual culprits but problematic areas, leadership, time in company metrics, and age metrics that relate to the rates. 
People Analytics not only involves Human Resources, but also involves Data Analysis and Finance, or at least a business understanding instead of Finance.

### Business understanding
Only a few information was passed on to this data which are:
<ul>
<li> The business is a chemistry industry </li>
<li> It has around 680 employees </li>
<li> There are 3 major business sectors, A, B, and C </li>
<li> Business A is most important sector </li>
<li> The company has more than 30 years </li>
</ul>

## Data Analysis
Gathering information from ERP called 'Senior Sistemas', it was able to retrieve dismissal from 2019 to June 2022 by employee's ID with the area, age in dismissal, time in company, initiative, admission date, and dismissal date in an excel table. Furthermore, it was gathered information about employees number by year by area in another excel table
